Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The were a client who wanted a game that they had designed for android Draw It or Lose It, on a online server that all operating systems could play.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I believe for this project I did a good job at making my recommendations for the client.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

I found looking at the clients needs made it easier to code the project as it allowed for more freedom when designing the code.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would have improved my evaluations section. The reason I chose this portion was because I made it to much like my recommendations section and I should have kept it more objective.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

After reading the users needs I new how much storage would be required and a good idea of what it would take to design the game. You have to take the users needs into consideration so you pick the right design tools for the job.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

When it came to designing software it was important to know how users would sign in and how their data would be stored whether it be on their personal system or cloud storage. I would look at design tools and storage before diving to much into the development stage making sure I lay my foundation first.
